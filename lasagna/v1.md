Ingredients:
```
- Bolognese
- Bechamel
- No boil lasagna (365 brand)
- 16 oz whole milk cottage cheese
- 5 oz double fat cottage cheese
- remaining cheese not put into bechamel
```

Procedure:
```
- Make bolognese
- Make bechamel
- pre-soak no boil pasta (how long was this?)
    - Did I need this step?
- Assembly
    - base layer bolognese
    - pasta -> bolognese -> bechamel -> cottage cheese -> repeat
    - top layer bechamel and cheese

- 375F bake
    - 40 min (?)
- 30 min cooldown
```

Notes:
- Pasta overcooked especially with carry over cooking
- definitely need to rest it longer for max visual appeal
- oven temp was not high enough to brown the cheese so not necessary next time?
